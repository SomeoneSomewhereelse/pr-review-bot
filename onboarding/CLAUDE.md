# onboarding/ — self-service setup wizard

Loaded when working under `onboarding/`. This is a **separate service** from
the review engine in `app/` — different process, different deploy, different
threat model. Root `CLAUDE.md`'s secret-handling section still applies in
full; the additions below are specific to what makes this service different.

## The invariant this service exists to protect

This backend is a **stateless relay**. It must never gain a database, a
session store, a cache, or any other place a visitor's credential could be
written to disk or held past the lifetime of a single request. If a task
here seems to need persistence, that is a signal to stop and reconsider the
design, not to add a datastore — durable state for this wizard was a
deliberate architectural choice to avoid (see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-onboarding-wizard-render-frame-design.md`
section 3), not an oversight to fix.

## Rules

- **Never log a visitor-supplied credential**, in full or truncated — same
  standard as root `CLAUDE.md` applies to the operator's own secrets, applied
  here to strangers' secrets, which if anything deserves *more* caution
  since these are people who did not choose to trust this codebase with
  their operational hygiene the way the project's own operator has.
- **Every relay endpoint takes a credential in the request body and returns
  a verdict — never the credential itself, never a derived artifact that
  reconstructs it.** A response schema that echoes back anything from the
  request beyond a boolean/enum/short display name (e.g. an account or
  owner name) needs a specific reason, not just convenience.
- **New external-service integrations follow the same relay shape** as the
  Render frame (`render_client.py` / `router.py`'s `/api/render/validate-key`
  pattern): browser holds the token, backend is a stateless pass-through per
  request. Do not special-case a "simple" integration into calling an
  external API directly from browser JS just because it doesn't strictly
  need server-side confidentiality (see design doc section 3 for why).
- **This service and the review engine (`app/`) do not import from each
  other's credential-handling code paths.** Shared *non-secret* utilities
  (HTTP client setup, logging config) may be factored into a common module
  if genuinely duplicated, but never a shared code path that touches both
  the operator's own long-lived credentials (`app/config.py`'s `Settings`)
  and a visitor's transient ones — keeping these separate is what lets each
  service's threat model be reasoned about independently.
